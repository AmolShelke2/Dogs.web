# The cutest animal:

I am a dog lover from my childhood I use to play with them without thinking of anyone because I am damn in love with their cuteness. and then when you get younger the responsibilities increases and then you get busy in work. so one day I just thought to make a webpage for my favourite pet and after thinking a while create this beautiful website. I know that this is only one page but I just love it.
